  "description": "Project - Bookmark & URL Shortener APP A Bookmark and URL shortener is an online application that converts a regular URL (the web address that starts with http://) into its condensed format. The user only has to copy the full URL of a website and paste it into the URL shortening tool to come up with an abbreviated version that is around 10 to 20 characters long. Regular URL - https://dctacademy.com/2018/05/become-full-stack-javascript-developer/ Shortened URL - http://bit.ly/2BPnAvF Why Are URLs Shortened? 1. Twitter posts have character limits. A tweet can only go as long as 140 characters, so sharing a full URL with your followers can be difficult. 2. Shortened URLs have more aesthetic appeal. 3. Some URL shorteners come with traffic monitors. It allows you to track the number of clicks the shortened link got over a certain period.",
